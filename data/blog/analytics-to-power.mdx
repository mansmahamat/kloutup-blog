In our enhanced analytics section is that you don't need to be a digital marketing expert to gain insights into your audience. We'll explain what each new piece of data means and how you can use it to strengthen your online strategy.

### Insights on views and clicks

We have data on views and clicks so you can see how many unique visitors have visited your page. Unique means that the visitor is only counted once, even if they have visited your page several times. This will give you an idea of how many people have visited your KloutUp. The total number of visits and clicks is the cumulative number of times your page has been viewed or clicked on. So if a user visits your KloutUp several times in a day, they will be counted each time.

### What does this mean for you?

More unique views and clicks means that your audience engagement increases. You can continue to see the popularity of your content by checking the total number of views and clicks. Tracking these metrics over time will give you a good indication of on-page performance.
