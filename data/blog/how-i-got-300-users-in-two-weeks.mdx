KloutUp is my third personal project and on the second one, I had trouble getting users .

What helped me first was the BUILD IN PUBLIC, I started KloutUp which is an alternative to Linktree for me basically, I started to share on Twitter my progress, the more I progressed the more I had requests from people who liked and wanted to have the same to share their links, this was a sign already of small validation.

So I decided to add the login function and give myself a maximum of 30 days in total to release the MVP, I figure more than 30 days could be a big waste of time and a huge disappointment if the project doesn't work out, as I say I share on twitter every day every step of the way, I post pictures, I explain what I'm doing, so I already have 20 people waiting to try it out, I'm creating a small group of beta testers who could help me to improve it.

Twitter is my first source, it's where I'm most active, I post the progress of the project on Linkedin as well to attract potential users, the objective is clearly to have some validation.

Before the release of the project I created the landing page (I have to improve it), I posted this landing page which explained the features of KloutUp, the problem solved on different platforms like Twitter, Likedin, Indie Hackers & Reddit.

The results were quite good, I got a lot of messages from people potentially interested. Here I was holding my validation, I wasn't sure to have many users yet but let's go for it and see when the project is released if it goes as planned.

I also have a mailing list of +900 people thanks to my newsletter and old projects where I can attract users and try to make them come by talking about the progress of my projects in the newsletter

I'm not making any money yet but it's up to me to improve in the future, In a fortnight I now have 300 users for me who has only been a developer for 2 years. I am very happy to have all these users from all over the world, I hope it will continue

The lesson I learned is that before releasing a project, validate the idea by talking and sharing the project wherever possible.
