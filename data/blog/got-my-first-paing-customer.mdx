What a feeling! A stranger is paying for something I built !
Basically I created KloutUp for myself to share my own with a cool UI, I got demand I adapted to release something, I tried to base it on what Linktree does.

### Stripe notification, 400 users & one big Twitter account.

The notification came while I was eating but what an exictation it is only 7 dollars but the satisfaction is to have built a service that someone appreciates and pays for.

I still have work to do on the project but hopefully this is the first of many.

In the same day I reached my 400th user in 1 month of launch, and a big football account with 1.6 million followers used KloutUp to register all its links.

I saw that in the month of the launch, i.e. January, I had 3,400 visits from all over the world, which is still impressive for me as I have only been a developer for 2 years.
