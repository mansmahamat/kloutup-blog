One of the most complicated things is to choose the stack for your startup, for me there is no perfect stack but the stack you are comfortable with.

KloutUP is what? Simply an alternative to Linktree, all your links on one page, visit analysis and the ability to monetize your page.

I decided to build the MVP in 30 days so as not to waste time, I always set myself this 30 day limit for an MVP.

I released KloutUp 1 month ago, I now have 280 users, the project seems promising.

In this post, I will show you the tools I use to create a SaaS that serves so many people, and why I chose these tools.

### FRONTEND

As I had 30 days, I chose familiar technologies

I chose Next JS for my front-end framework for its performance, SEO and SSR, coupled with Typescript because I want strong code.

On the CSS side it's Tailwind that manages it, I'm fully satisfied with it, especially since I use Tailwind UI, a nice component library that I can customize.

### BACKEND

I don't really have a backend, I use the Next JS API to make my calls.

Supabase for the database: Our data is highly relational, so I'm really, really happy that I chose to use SQL rather than NoSql for the KloutUp database.

### HOSTING

Hosting
We host all our websites on Vercel. This includes the blog and my application.

Vercel is really my favourite tool to host my code.

### OTHER TOOLS

Plausible for visit analytics

Crisp for support chat

Stripe to collect payments

Sendgrid to send emails

I18n-next to easily manage translation

Senja: to Collect testimonials.
